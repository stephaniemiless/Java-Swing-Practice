JFrame class

The javax.swing.JFrame class is a type of container that inherits the java.awt.Frame
class. 

JFrame works like the main window where components like labels, buttons, textfields,
etc are added to create a GUI.

Unlike Frame, however, JFrame gives the option to hide or close the window.
