JComponent class

The JComponent class is the base class of all Swing components (except top-level
containers). 

Swing components that start with 'J' are descendants of the JComponent class.

JButton, JScrollPane, JPanel, JTable, etc are descendants of JComponent but 
JFrame and JDialog do not inherit JComponent because they are the children of 
top-level containers. 

The JComponent class extends the Container class which itself extends the 
Component class. The Container class has support for adding components to the 
container.
